# Public Data Pipeline for Business Insights (Kotlin Edition)

This project is a Kotlin-based version of the original **Public Data Pipeline for Business Insights**.

It demonstrates how to build a lightweight data pipeline using only Kotlin — from fetching public data via API to saving and processing it locally. The pipeline uses real demographic data from IBGE (the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics).

---

**Project Overview**

This pipeline includes:

- **Data Extraction**: Fetches population data by state from the IBGE API.
- **Data Transformation**: Parses and structures the data into a clean format.
- **Data Load**: Saves the data locally as a CSV file for further analysis or reporting.

---

**Tech Stack**

- **Kotlin** (JVM)
- **Standard Library I/O**
- **org.json** for lightweight JSON parsing
- Gradle for dependency and project management

**How to Run**

Clone the project and run it using Gradle:

```bash
./gradlew run
```

The output will be saved at:

```
data/population_ibge.csv
```

**Example Output**

```csv
State,Population
São Paulo,46000000
Minas Gerais,21000000
Rio de Janeiro,17000000
...
```

**Why Kotlin?**

- Modern, concise, and safe syntax
- Fully interoperable with the JVM and Java ecosystem
- Ideal for scalable pipelines and microservices
- A unique portfolio differentiator in a Python-dominant field
